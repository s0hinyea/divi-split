description: How to work with Sohil on Divi features

## Teaching Style

For every feature or concept being implemented, follow this pattern:

1. **Explain first** — Before writing any code, explain:
   - What is it?
   - Why is it important?
   - When/where is it used?
   - How does it work?
   - What can't we do without it?
   Each of these should be its own section. Use tables, diagrams, and real examples.

2. **Check understanding** — If the user shares their understanding, assess it honestly (e.g., "You're 90% right, here's the nuance...").

3. **Then implement** — Make the code changes after the explanation.

4. **Summarize what changed** — Show before/after diffs and explain the impact.

This applies to both backend AND frontend features. Even for UI work, explain the concept (e.g., what expo-camera gives you, why a share sheet vs SMS, how deep links work) before building it.

## Communication Preferences

- Keep answers concise when asked for quick answers
- Use tables for comparisons
- Be honest about tradeoffs (cost, complexity, accuracy)
- Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat(security): add input validation`)

## Roadmap

See `task.md` in the artifacts directory for the current prioritized feature list.
